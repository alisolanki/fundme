## The problem Fund Me solves
Fund Me helps raise funding for Projects using Quadratic Funding.

Using Fund Me, users can find projects to fund for and submit their projects to the existing funding buckets as well.

The project has integrated Matic as well as Portis.

## Challenges the project ran into
Coming up with the idea was the tough part and getting the supported information about Quadratic funding.

### Authenticating whether the user is genuine or not:
* This was solved using the principle of Quadratic Funding which takes popularity (number of contributors) into account as well (along with the amount raised).
* This was also solved by ideating that projects will promote their projects' funding pages on their Socials to verify.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
cd client
npm start
```

## Usage

The contract has been deployed on Matic Mumbai Network: 0x7F6598bE75ED9c64da3ea3Fb03659b0921b9E0E8
